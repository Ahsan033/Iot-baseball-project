# Iot-baseball-project
This project centers around an IoT application developed using Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT to aid youth baseball league conveners in making weather-dependent decisions. The application provides real-time guidance on whether games should proceed, be postponed, or canceled based on player age and weather conditions fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
